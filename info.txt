No need to drain or carry around a can opener—all you need for this fish is a fork.
Protein will fill you up even longer when mixed with fat or fiber.
Mix some guacamole, which has both, into the pouch.

Hard-Boiled Eggs
Eggs are rich in BCAAs to help you build muscle.
Boil a bunch to keep at work so you don’t head for the vending machine.
Look for omega-3 enriched eggs, which are good for your brain.[1]
